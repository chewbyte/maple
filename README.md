## Vision
- We will provide a system that allows people to start and engage in conversations that are tethered to locations/points of interest within cities
- The system will provide people with a real-time, physical awareness of the ‘goings-on’ around their city. It will be built in a way that encourages the physical “navigation” of the day-today life and culture of a city.
- The system can support a number of use cases including buy not limited to:
   1. Events and gatherings – whether spontaneous, ‘one-off’ or frequent
   2. Local and national debate – encouraging dialogue and action in regards to important issues within communities
   3. Awareness – informing people of dangers, disruptions to public services or neighbourhood vigilance
   4. Supporting curiosity – allowing people to seek answers, learn and discover regarding the ‘sights and sounds’ of a city
